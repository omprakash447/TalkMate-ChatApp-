Real-time Chat Application
This is a real-time chat application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Socket.IO. The app allows users to send instant messages, engage in private conversations, and participate in group chats with seamless real-time communication. With features like message persistence, user authentication, and responsive design, this app offers a modern, scalable solution for messaging.

Features:
Real-time Messaging: The app utilizes Socket.IO for bi-directional, real-time communication between users. Messages are sent and received instantly without requiring the page to refresh.
User Authentication: Secure authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), allowing users to register, log in, and maintain sessions with encryption and security.
Private and Group Chats: Users can send private messages to one another or create group chats to interact with multiple users at once.
Message Persistence: All messages are saved in a MongoDB database, ensuring that they are accessible even after the user logs out, refreshes the page, or reopens the app.
Real-time Notifications: Users receive push notifications for new messages, ensuring they are always notified of incoming communications, even when not actively viewing the chat.
Responsive Design: Built with React and styled-components, the app is designed to be fully responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a seamless experience for both desktop and mobile users.
